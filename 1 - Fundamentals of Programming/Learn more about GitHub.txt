Github is different from the notebook you guys are using, it is truly designed for coding and has way more flexibility of
exporting files or sharing files.

How to use:
1. To run a code, install the python extension first (simply hop on any .py files and there will be a message on the bottom
hand corner asking you whether you wanna download), then you will find a run button in a shape of a triangle pointing to
the right on the top right hand corner. When you wanna run, just click on it and the output will appear in the terminal
underneath.

2. To save a file, go to source control on the left sidebar (underneath the magnifying glass), you will see a text box
above the "COMMIT" button. Type "git commit" and press on the button.
